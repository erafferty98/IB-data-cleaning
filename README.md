# IB-data-cleaning
# Notebook Purpose: 
# This Jupyter notebook aims to create a clean and comprehensive dataset containing flights from Iberia and its partners. 
# It addresses several issues found in the initial dataset obtained from IB Systems, such as missing IDs, 
# inconsistent ID matching, and incomplete flying data for partner flights. 
# Additionally, the IAGL data lacks elite points information and fare product data. 
# To overcome these shortcomings, we will reverse-engineer elite points based on published Iberia tier point awarding and zones. 
# Furthermore, we will enhance partner flying data, such as British Airways (BA) and Qatar Airways, by providing more detailed information. 
# Ultimately, the goal of this worksheet is to consolidate and refine the data to ensure accuracy and reliability in all aspects.
